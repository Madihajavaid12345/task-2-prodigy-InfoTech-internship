ðŸ”¹ Taskâ€¯2 Completed: Titanic Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve just completed **Task 2** of my Data Science internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**! ðŸš¢ðŸ“Š

**ðŸ“Œ What I Did:**
â€¢ Cleaned the Titanic dataset: filled missing `Age` with median, `Embarked` with mode, and dropped `Cabin` due to excessive missing values  
â€¢ Engineered new features: `FamilySize` and `IsAlone`  
â€¢ Explored patterns with visualizations:
  - Survival by Gender and Passenger Class  
  - Age distribution and its relationship to survival  
  - The impact of family size and port of embarkation

**ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies:**
â€¢ Python â€¢ pandas â€¢ matplotlib â€¢ seaborn  
â€¢ Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

**ðŸ“Š Key Insights:**
â€¢ Women and first-class passengers were more likely to survive  
â€¢ Younger passengers had higher survival rates  
â€¢ Passengers traveling alone or with small families faced lower survival odds  
â€¢ Embarkation port and fare indicated socio-economic influences on survival
